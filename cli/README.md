## `stats` — deterministic SVG measurement

Emits a structured JSON report for a hatch3d-emitted SVG: path/vertex counts,
physical arc length, per-layer breakdown, an ink-density grid, a pen-travel
estimate, and plottability warnings. No rendering, no model calls — this is the
measurement half of the agent loop (see the vault design pod
`active/plotter-art-workflow`). The core lives in `src/stats/analyze.ts` and is
importable directly (the InkSight browser tool consumes the same functions).

```bash
npm run stats -- --input render.svg
npm run stats -- --input render.svg --pen-width 0.3 --grid 12
npm run render -- -c flowField | npm run stats          # SVG from stdin
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- | ------- |
| `-i, --input FILE` | stdin | SVG file to analyze |
| `--pen-width MM` | recovered from SVG | Override pen width (mm) |
| `--grid N` | 8 | Density grid resolution (N×N) |
| `--saturation-threshold C` | 1.0 | Coverage at/above which a cell counts as saturated |
| `--compact` | off | Single-line JSON instead of pretty-printed |

### Scope

Targets SVG produced by hatch3d's exporter: absolute `M`/`L` polyline paths
inside a `translate(cx,cy) scale(S)` group, with an mm-unit `viewBox` and a
margin clip rect. Curves (`C`/`Q`/`A`/…), relative commands, and closepath are
**rejected with a clear error** rather than silently mis-measured. Both
single-group and layered (per-pen `<g>`) exports are supported.

### Report schema

All lengths and areas are in millimetres (recovered from the `viewBox` mm units
and the group `scale`). Ink density is a coverage proxy: `arcLength × penWidth /
area` — for a constant pen width this approximates the filled-pixel ratio, so a
cell at `1.0` is effectively solid ink (line spacing has dropped below the pen
width).

```jsonc
{
  "input": "render.svg",                 // file label, or null for stdin
  "page":     { "widthMm", "heightMm" }, // page size from viewBox
  "drawable": { "xMm", "yMm", "widthMm", "heightMm", "areaMm2" }, // inside margins
  "penWidthMm": 0.5,
  "penWidthSource": "flag" | "svg" | "default",
  "scale": 0.33375,                       // path-space → mm factor
  "totals": {
    "layers", "paths", "vertices", "segments",
    "arcLengthMm",                        // total drawn line length
    "penUpTravelMm",                      // travel between paths in file order (no reorder)
    "boundingBox": { "xMm", "yMm", "widthMm", "heightMm" },
    "bboxCoverageRatio",                  // bbox area / drawable area
    "inkDensity"                          // global coverage proxy
  },
  "layers": [
    { "id", "stroke", "paths", "vertices", "segments", "arcLengthMm", "inkDensity" }
  ],
  "densityGrid": {
    "cols", "rows",
    "cells",                              // rows×cols coverage matrix
    "max", "mean",
    "cv"                                  // coefficient of variation — spatial balance
  },
  "warnings": {
    "marginViolationPaths",               // paths with a vertex outside the margins
    "saturatedCells",                     // cells with coverage ≥ threshold
    "saturationThreshold"
  }
}
```

### Reading the numbers

- **`densityGrid.cv`** — spatial balance. Low (< ~0.5) means ink is spread
  evenly; high (> ~1.5) means it clumps (e.g. centered geometry with empty
  margins). This is the fast signal for "unbalanced composition."
- **`warnings.saturatedCells`** — regions that will plot as solid black with the
  declared pen; usually a sign to widen hatch pitch or drop a layer.
- **`warnings.marginViolationPaths`** — geometry that the margin clip will cut
  off; the composition is overflowing the page.
- **`penUpTravelMm`** — a rough plot-efficiency signal. High pen-up travel
  relative to `arcLengthMm` means `vpype linesort` will help a lot at prep time.

## `stats:diff` — variability across variants

Given N rendered SVG variants of a composition, computes two variability metrics
and classifies the set. The improve-mode routine uses this to decide whether a
composition's parameter space is too thin to be worth keeping as-is.

```bash
npm run stats:diff -- v0.svg v1.svg v2.svg v3.svg v4.svg
```

- **`pathCountCoV`** — coefficient of variation of the SVG path count across
  variants. Catches parameters with no structural effect.
- **`arcLengthCoV`** — CoV of (total arc length / drawable area). Catches density
  changes that path count misses (same stroke count, different tightness).
- **`band`** — `low` / `medium` / `high` off `max(pathCountCoV, arcLengthCoV)`.
  `low` → the routine proposes a new parameter; `high` → variants are already
  well-differentiated. Thresholds are named constants in `src/stats/variability.ts`
  (`VARIABILITY_THRESHOLDS`), pending empirical calibration.

Observed on a real phyllotaxisGarden sweep: varying the structural `count`
(8→40) gives `pathCountCoV ≈ 0.47` (**high**); varying the cosmetic
`sizeVariation` (±0.04) gives `pathCountCoV = 0`, `arcLengthCoV ≈ 0.01`
(**low** — "propose a new parameter"). The LOW=0.05 / HIGH=0.2 thresholds
cleanly separate the two.

## `patch` — signal-flow patches (L2 prototype)

A **patch** extends the Scene IR from a construction *tree* into a signal-flow
*graph* — the eurorack model. Nodes are modules; the "cables" carry three signal
types (the common interface): **Geometry** (polylines, the audio), **Field**
(scalar/vector functions over the canvas, the CV), and scalars/curves (knobs).
A parameter can be *modulated* by a field, and a `repeat` block gives **bounded
iteration** (a `for` loop, not a wall-clock clock) — so a patch still evaluates
deterministically to polylines and stays measurable by `stats`.

```bash
npm run patch -- --dsl examples/patches/flow-modulated.patch -o out.svg
npm run patch -- --dsl examples/patches/flow-modulated.patch --print-graph   # compiled JSON
npm run patch -- --graph patch.json -o out.png -f png
```

The DSL is the thin authoring surface; it compiles to a zod-validated JSON graph
(`src/patch/graph.ts`). Every node is named, so every intermediate signal is
inspectable. Fn names that aren't reserved operators are composition ids
(generator nodes).

```
ground = contourMap(contourLevels: 24)       # generator → Geometry
d      = density(ground, cell: 24)           # Geometry → ScalarField  (the cable)
grad   = gradient(d)                          # ScalarField → VectorField
warped = distort(ground, by: grad, amp: 10)   # modulate geometry by a field (CV)
repeat 3 {                                     # bounded iteration (deterministic)
  flow   = simplexVector(scale: 0.006, seed: 9)
  warped = distort(warped, by: flow, amp: 4)
}
out(warped @ "#1d4ed8")
```

Operators: `simplexScalar`, `simplexVector`, `density`, `gradient`, `distort`,
`cull`, `thin`, `pen`. This is the L2 tier (static, deterministic); L3 (a live
temporal runtime) is a separate research track.
